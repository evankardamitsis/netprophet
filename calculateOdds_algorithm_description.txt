NETPROPHET TENNIS ODDS CALCULATION ALGORITHM
============================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The NetProphet odds calculation algorithm is a sophisticated system designed to predict tennis match outcomes and generate betting odds. It uses multiple weighted factors to calculate win probabilities and converts them to decimal odds with a built-in margin for bookmaker profit.

CORE ALGORITHM STRUCTURE
------------------------

1. INPUT VALIDATION
   - Validates player data using Zod schemas
   - Ensures all required fields are present and within valid ranges
   - Validates match context (surface type)

2. FACTOR CALCULATION
   The algorithm calculates 7 key factors that influence match outcomes:

   a) NTRP Rating Advantage (Weight: 30-50% Dynamic)
      - Compares player NTRP ratings (1.0-7.0 scale)
      - Dynamic weighting based on difference size:
        * 1.0+ differences: 50% weight (significantly increased)
        * 0.5+ differences: 40% weight (increased)
        * <0.5 differences: 30% weight (base)
      - Enhanced scaling for significant differences (0.5+):
        * Uses linear scaling with 2.0x multiplier (increased from 1.5x)
        * Direct impact: ntrp_diff * 2.0, clamped to ±0.8
      - Level-aware scaling for smaller differences:
        * Level multipliers: 4.5+ (1.2x), 4.0-4.5 (1.0x), 3.5-4.0 (0.8x), <3.5 (0.6x)
        * Enhanced sigmoid function (tanh) with 1.0x multiplier (increased from 0.8x)

   b) Form Advantage (Weight: 15%)
      - Combines overall win rate with recent form
      - Uses Bayesian average for players with <10 matches
      - Recent form weighted: [40%, 25%, 20%, 10%, 5%] for last 5 matches
      - Adaptive weighting based on total match count

   c) Surface Advantage (Weight: 10%)
      - Uses surface-specific win rates if available
      - Falls back to preference-based calculation (65% vs 35%)
      - Supports Hard Court, Clay Court, Grass Court, Indoor
      - Surface advantage = (p1_surface_rate - p2_surface_rate) * 0.3

   d) Head-to-Head Advantage (Weight: 15%)
      - Uses historical match results between players
      - Recent matches (<180 days) get 5% bonus/penalty
      - H2H advantage = (win_rate - 0.5) * 1.5 + recent_bonus

   e) Experience Advantage (Weight: 8%)
      - Combines age (30%) and match count (70%)
      - Experience = age * 0.3 + total_matches * 0.7
      - Advantage = tanh(experience_diff * 0.005)

   f) Momentum Advantage (Weight: 5%)
      - Based on current winning/losing streaks
      - Uses square root scaling for diminishing returns
      - Momentum = sqrt(streak_length) * (winning ? 1 : -1)
      - Advantage = tanh(momentum_diff * 0.15)

   g) Fatigue Advantage (Weight: 2%)
      - Compares fatigue levels (0-10 scale)
      - Lower fatigue = advantage
      - Advantage = tanh(fatigue_diff * 0.1)

3. PROBABILITY CALCULATION
   - Starts with 50% base probability for player 1
   - Applies weighted factor adjustments with dynamic NTRP weighting
   - Adds 5% uncertainty factor (random ±2.5%)
   - Dynamic bounds based on NTRP difference:
     * Default: 20% to 80% (realistic range)
     * 0.5+ differences: 15% to 85% (moderate extreme)
     * 1.0+ differences: 10% to 90% (significant extreme)
     * 1.5+ differences: 5% to 95% (maximum extreme)
   - Player 2 probability = 1 - player 1 probability

4. ODDS CONVERSION
   - Converts probabilities to decimal odds
   - Adds 5% margin for bookmaker profit
   - Formula: odds = (1 / probability) * 1.05
   - Rounds to 2 decimal places

5. CONFIDENCE CALCULATION
   - Base confidence: 60%
   - Data completeness bonuses:
     * 15+ matches each: +15%
     * 30+ matches each: +10%
     * Surface data available: +5%
     * H2H data available: +10%
   - Factor agreement bonus:
     * High variance (>0.6): +10%
     * Very high variance (>1.0): +5%
   - Clamped between 30% and 95%

6. RECOMMENDATIONS GENERATION
   - Prioritizes H2H data (highest impact)
   - Includes NTRP advantages, surface expertise
   - Mentions form streaks and fatigue levels
   - Limited to top 3 most relevant recommendations
